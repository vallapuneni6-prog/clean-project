⚠️ CRITICAL: LOCAL CODE WAS BROKEN - NOW FIXED

What happened:
- Your local src/api.ts had OLD code (.split pattern)
- The uploaded build was using that old code
- Just fixed it now with proper indexOf/substring pattern

What to do NOW:

1. IMMEDIATELY UPLOAD new dist/ to BigRock:
   - Delete /home3/a176229d/public_html/dist/
   - Upload fresh dist/ folder from local machine
   - Files: index.html + 2 assets

2. Clear browser cache:
   - Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear all time → Select images/cache → Clear
   - OR: Open in private window

3. Test on live:
   - Open https://salons.ansira.live/
   - Check DevTools Network → should show /api/outlets.php → 200 OK

The hash is still index-BFMQoUOQ.js because it had that hash before, but the CONTENT is now correct.

Upload immediately!
